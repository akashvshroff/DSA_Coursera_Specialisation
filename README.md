# Outline
- This repository contains all of my coursework that I covered in the Data Structures and Algorithms specialisation offered by the University of California, San Diego and the National Research University Higher School of Economics on Coursera.
- The collection of 6 courses covers many different forms of algorithms, the strategies that one could use while solving problems, data structures and their role in optimising solutions as well as how to gauge the complexity of an algorithm and by extension its running time.
- Links to each of the programming assignments as well as a better explanation of what they entail can be found in the description below.

# Purpose
- In order to become a more astute programmer, I wanted to go deeper into the world of algorithms and problem-solving in CS. This subject area was of keen interest to me owing to my fascination with puzzles and desire to work in some back-end/data science capacity. To introduce myself to this whole sphere of complexity, algorithms and data structures, I found this Coursera specialisation which is a very comprehensive guide into the deeper realms of Computer Science.
- Although rigorous and rather challenging at times, I am thoroughly enjoying this specialisation as it is allowing me to gain a deeper understanding into how a problem can be tackled and equipping me with tools to make my own solutions much more efficient.

# Description
- Use the links below to access any program - each program contains documentation about what the problem entails and I've included a few descriptive words below as well.
